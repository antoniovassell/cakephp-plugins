Basic CakePHP Repository for testing/demonstrating CakePHP Plugins
==================================

Basic CakePHP Repository for testing/demonstrating CakePHP Plugins.
Also, it goes to show how much code is already there to create full fledged production applications without doing everything from scratch. Allowing developers to concentrate on the business value features of their applications.

Imagine just including a Search or Users plugin to handle those features instead of writing all that code to do so.

Here are the list of plugins included so far

 * [Search](https://github.com/CakeDC/search)
 * [Migrations](https://github.com/CakeDC/migrations)
 * [Utils](https://github.com/CakeDC/utils)
 * [DebugKit](https://github.com/cakephp/debug_kit)

Requirements
------------

 * CakePHP 2.0+
 * PHP 5.3+

Documentation
-------------

@todo: Installation instructions here.

Depending on how much configuration here, I will add some detailed documentation in the future.
